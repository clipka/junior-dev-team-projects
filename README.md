Projects for my website _www.junior-dev-team.de_

I am going to use the projects to explain programming to kids in our local primary school.

## Games

### Ticktacktoe

Easy game to explain game mechanics and implement simple game rules in a programming language.
The goal is to understand basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Game of Life

Create a simple game loop and build on top of Ticktacktoe. Some more 'advanced' programming features are introduced.

### Number guessing game

A simple game to guess a number. The goal is to learn about input validation.
